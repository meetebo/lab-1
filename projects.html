        <h2>A Database For Blue Rose Rental Services</h2>
        <p>
            <blockquote>
            This was an individual project I undertook to create <br>
             a database for my father's rental company. This system <br>
              was meant to take record of a Tenant's personal details, <br>
               transaction details, and tenancy details. This would make <br>
               record keeping easier and also aid in tracking the time left <br>
               on a Tenant's agreement to be able to plan ahead.
